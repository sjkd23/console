- Raid thread management for organized logging

The system consists of three main components:

---

- Node.js 18+

## Architecture- Docker & Docker Compose (easiest), or PostgreSQL 14+ if running manually

- Discord bot token ([get one here](https://discord.com/developers/applications))

The system consists of three main components:

### Setup (Docker - Recommended)

### Discord Bot (Discord.js)

Clone the repo:

Handles all Discord interactions including slash commands, button clicks, and automated tasks. Communicates with the backend API via HTTP with API key authentication.

```bash

### Backend API (Fastify)git clone <your-repo-url>

cd rotmg-raid-bot

REST API that manages all data operations, enforces permissions, and maintains the PostgreSQL database. Handles authorization, quota calculations, and data validation.```



### Database (PostgreSQL)Create `backend/.env`:



Stores all guild configurations, run data, member information, verification sessions, punishments, quota events, and audit logs. Uses 46+ migration files for schema management.```env

PORT=4000

**Communication Flow:**BACKEND_API_KEY=your_secret_key_here

DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres:postgres@db:5432/rotmg_raids

```text```

Discord User → Bot (validates & defers) → Backend API (authorizes & processes) → Database

Database → Backend API (returns data) → Bot (updates Discord UI) → Discord UserCreate `bot/.env`:

```

```env

---APPLICATION_ID=your_discord_app_id

SECRET_KEY=your_discord_bot_token

## InstallationDISCORD_DEV_GUILD_ID=your_test_server_id

BACKEND_URL=http://backend:4000/v1

### PrerequisitesBACKEND_API_KEY=your_secret_key_here

```

- Node.js 18+ (LTS recommended)

- Docker & Docker Compose (recommended), or PostgreSQL 14+Make sure `BACKEND_API_KEY` matches in both files.

- Discord bot token from [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)

Fire it up:

### Quick Start with Docker (Recommended)

```bash

1. **Clone the repository**docker-compose up -d

docker-compose logs -f bot  # watch it start

   ```bash```

   git clone <your-repo-url>

   cd rotmg-raid-botFirst run takes a minute - it's installing deps and running database migrations.

   ```

### Setup (Manual)

2. **Configure backend** - Create `backend/.env`:

If you don't want Docker:

   ```env

   PORT=4000**Backend:**

   BACKEND_API_KEY=your_secure_random_key_here```bash

   DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres:postgres@db:5432/rotmg_raidscd backend

   NODE_ENV=productionnpm install

   ```npm run migrate  # set up database

npm run dev

3. **Configure bot** - Create `bot/.env`:```



   ```env**Bot:**

   APPLICATION_ID=your_discord_application_id```bash

   SECRET_KEY=your_discord_bot_tokencd bot

   DISCORD_DEV_GUILD_ID=your_test_server_id_optionalnpm install

   BACKEND_URL=http://backend:4000/v1npm run register  # register commands with Discord

   BACKEND_API_KEY=your_secure_random_key_herenpm run dev

   NODE_ENV=production```

   ```

### Configure Your Server

   **Important:** `BACKEND_API_KEY` must match in both files.

Once the bot's online, run these in Discord:

4. **Start all services**

**1. Map roles** (required):

   ```bash```

   docker-compose up -d/setroles

   ```  organizer: @Raid Leader

  security: @Security

   First startup takes a few minutes to install dependencies and run database migrations.  verified_raider: @Verified

  suspended: @Suspended

5. **Verify startup**```



   ```bash**2. Map channels** (recommended):

   docker-compose logs -f bot```

   ```/setchannels

  raid: #raids

   Look for: `Successfully registered X commands` and `Bot is ready!`  veri_log: #verification-log

  punishment_log: #moderation-log

### Manual Installation  quota: #quota-boards

```

If you prefer running services directly:

**3. Test it:**

**Backend:**```

/run dungeon:Shatters

```bash```

cd backend

npm installYou should see an embed with buttons. Click Join to test interactions.

npm run migrate  # Run database migrations

npm run dev      # Start with hot reload---

```

## How to Use

**Bot:**

### Running Raids

```bash

cd botThe `/run` command creates a raid post with buttons:

npm install

npm run register # Register slash commands with Discord```

npm run dev      # Start with hot reload/run dungeon:Shatters party:Nexus2 location:USEast

``````



Ensure PostgreSQL is running and `DATABASE_URL` in `backend/.env` points to your database.Autocomplete shows your server's recently used dungeons. Raiders click Join, pick their class, and you click Organizer Panel to Start/End the run. If you forget to end it, the bot does it automatically after 2 hours.



---For quick interest checks:



## Initial Configuration```

/headcount

After the bot is online, configure your Discord server:```



### 1. Configure Roles (Required)Pick up to 10 dungeons. People can join and mark which dungeons they have keys for. Convert to a full run when ready, or just cancel it.



Map your Discord roles to bot permission levels:### Verifying Members



```text**Automated (RealmEye):**

/setroles1. `/configverification send-panel channel:#get-verified`

  administrator: @Admin2. Users click "Get Verified"

  moderator: @Moderator3. Bot DMs them for their IGN

  head_organizer: @Head Organizer4. They add a code to their RealmEye profile

  officer: @Officer5. Bot verifies automatically

  security: @Security

  organizer: @Raid Leader**Manual (Screenshots):**

  verified_raider: @Verified1. Same panel, different button

  suspended: @Suspended2. User uploads vault screenshot with Discord tag visible

  muted: @Muted3. Creates a ticket in #manual-verifications

  team: @Team4. Security+ staff approve or deny

```

**Manual Override:**

**Minimum required:** `organizer`, `security`, and `verified_raider`Security staff can always force-verify someone:

```

### 2. Configure Channels (Recommended)/verify member:@Player ign:TheirIGN

```

Tell the bot where to post logs and panels:

### Moderation

```text

/setchannels**Warnings:**

  raid: #raids```

  veri_log: #verification-logs/warn member:@Player reason:Rushed and died

  punishment_log: #moderation-logs```

  raid_log: #raid-threads

  quota: #quota-leaderboards**Suspensions:**

  getverified: #get-verified```

  manual_verification: #manual-verifications/suspend member:@Player duration_days:3 reason:Repeated violations

  bot_log: #bot-activity```

  role_ping: #role-pings

```Bot assigns the Suspended role and removes it when time's up.



### 3. Test Basic Functionality**Check history:**

```

Create a test run to verify everything works:/checkpunishments member:@Player

```

```text

/run dungeon:ShattersShows warnings, suspensions, and staff notes. Paginated if there's lots.

```

**Staff notes** (silent warnings):

If you see an interactive embed with buttons, the bot is working correctly.```

/addnote member:@Player note:Watch this person

---```



## Usage GuideOnly Security+ can see these.



### Creating Runs### Quota System



Use `/run` to create raid panels:Track who's actively organizing and verifying. Optional but useful for promotions.



```text**Setup:**

/run dungeon:Shatters party:Nexus2 location:USEast description:Bring priests```

```/configquota role:@Raid Leader

```

**Features:**

Opens a panel where you:

- Dungeon autocomplete shows recently used dungeons- Set required points (e.g., "10 runs per month")

- Participants click "Join" and select their class- Set reset date (absolute datetime like "2025-12-01T00:00:00Z")

- Organizer Panel provides Start/End/Pop Keys controls- Override points per dungeon (Shatters = 3, Pirate Cave = 1)

- Runs automatically end after 2 hours if not manually ended- Create auto-updating leaderboard

- For Oryx 3 runs, use `/taken` to submit completion screenshot

Points are awarded automatically when runs end or people get verified. You can also manually adjust:

### Headcounts

```

Gauge interest before committing to full runs:/logrun dungeon:Shatters amount:1     # add quota points

/logkey member:@Raider dungeon:Shatters amount:1  # log key pops

```text/addquotapoints member:@Officer amount:5  # direct adjustment

/headcount```

```

View stats:

Select up to 10 dungeons. Members can join and indicate which dungeons they have keys for. Convert to a full run when ready, or cancel if interest is low.```

/stats  # your stats

### Member Verification/stats member:@Someone  # their stats

```

**Setup verification panel:**

---

```text

/configverification send-panel channel:#get-verified## Architecture

```

The bot has two main pieces:

**Verification methods:**

**Discord.js Bot** - Handles all Discord interactions (commands, buttons, events). When something happens, it calls the backend API.

- **RealmEye (Automated)**: Members receive DM, provide IGN, add code to RealmEye profile

- **Manual (Screenshot)**: Members upload vault screenshot, Security+ staff review ticket**Fastify Backend** - REST API that manages all the data in PostgreSQL. Handles authorization, runs CRUD operations, tracks quota, etc.



**Manual verification override:**They communicate via HTTP with API key authentication.



```text**Key flows:**

/verify member:@Player ign:TheirRotmgName

```*Creating a run:*

1. User runs `/run dungeon:Shatters`

### Moderation Commands2. Bot checks permissions via API

3. Bot creates run in database via `POST /runs`

**Warnings:**4. Bot posts embed with buttons in Discord

5. Database gets the Discord message ID for updates

```text

/warn member:@Player reason:Rushing and dying repeatedly*Ending a run:*

```1. Organizer clicks "End" button

2. Bot calls `PATCH /runs/:id` with status='ended'

**Suspensions (timed):**3. Backend logs quota event automatically

4. Backend calculates points based on dungeon config

```text5. Bot updates embed and refreshes quota leaderboards

/suspend member:@Player duration:3d reason:Multiple rule violations

```*Auto-role sync:*

1. Admin assigns @Raid Leader to someone

Suspended role is automatically removed when time expires.2. Bot detects role change event

3. Bot checks if they have any staff roles

**Check punishment history:**4. Bot automatically assigns @Team role

5. Reverse happens when staff roles removed

```text

/checkpunishments member:@Player active_only:false---

```

**Configure role pings for dungeons:**```



```text---

/configrolepings

```## Known Issues



**Send role ping panel:**Let's be honest about what doesn't work yet:



```text**Missing Features:**

/sendrolepingembed- No bench/leave buttons in UI (backend supports it, just not exposed)

```- Can't view who joined a run except by looking at the counter

- No `/runhistory` command to browse past runs

Members can toggle which dungeon types they want to be pinged for.- Auto-end duration is hardcoded at 2 hours

- No voice channel integration

---- Tested mostly in one server - multi-guild edge cases might exist



## Project Structure**Bugs:**

- If you're missing env vars, bot crashes with cryptic errors instead of telling you what's wrong

```text- Race condition if two organizers click "End" at the same time

rotmg-raid-bot/- Bot can't manage roles higher than its own role (Discord limitation, but error message could be better)

### Bot Not Responding to Commands---



**Causes & Solutions:**## Recent Updates (v0.3.0)



- Verify commands are registered: Check `docker-compose logs bot` for "Successfully registered"**Manual Verification**

- Ensure bot has proper permissions: Send Messages, Embed Links, Manage Roles- Dual verification: RealmEye or screenshot upload

- Configure roles: Run `/setroles` to map at least organizer and verified_raider- Ticket system for Security+ approval

- Custom instructions per guild

### Permission Errors (NOT_ORGANIZER, etc.)- DM notifications for status updates



**Causes & Solutions:****Decimal Points**

- Award fractional points (0.5, 1.25, etc.)

- User lacks required role configured in `/setroles`- Works for quota, raider, and key pop points

- Bot cannot see user's roles (permission issue)- Backward compatible with integers

- Role hierarchy: Bot's role must be higher than roles it manages

**Bot Log Channel**

### Backend Connection Errors- New channel type for general bot activity

- Optional command execution logging

**Causes & Solutions:**- Configurable via `/setchannels`



- Check `BACKEND_URL` in `bot/.env` matches backend location**Previous (v0.2.0)**

- Verify `BACKEND_API_KEY` matches in both `.env` files- Headcount system (multi-dungeon interest checks)

- If using Docker: Ensure services can communicate (`docker-compose logs`)- Command execution logging for analytics

- Raid thread management

### Database Issues- RealmEye verification flow

- Raider points system

**Causes & Solutions:**- Key pop tracking

- Staff notes system

- Verify PostgreSQL is running and accessible

- Check `DATABASE_URL` format: `postgres://user:pass@host:port/database`---

- Migration failures: Check which migration failed and fix schema manually

- For fresh start: Drop database and re-run `npm run migrate`## License



### Verification Not WorkingNot specified. If open-sourcing, consider MIT.



**Causes & Solutions:**---



- Configure channels: `/setchannels getverified:#channel manual_verification:#channel`## Acknowledgments

- RealmEye down: Check if realmeye.com is accessible

- DM permissions: Users must allow DMs from server membersBuilt for the ROTMG community by people who got tired of managing runs in spreadsheets.

- Manual tickets: Ensure manual_verification channel is set and bot has permissions

Thanks to Discord.js and Fastify teams for excellent libraries.

- Set quota channel: `/setchannels quota:#channel`**Version:** 0.3.0  

- Check bot has Send Messages and Embed Links permissions in quota channel**Status:** Production ready

- Verify role in `/configquota` exists and has members

- Trigger update by completing a run or logging quota manuallyNeed help? Open an issue with:

## Technology Stack- Your setup (Docker/manual, OS)



| Component | Technology | Version | Purpose |The quota system tracks and rewards organizer and verifier activity, providing leaderboards and progress tracking.

|-----------|-----------|---------|---------|

| Bot | Discord.js | 14.16.3 | Discord bot framework |### How It Works

| Backend | Fastify | 4.28.1 | REST API server |

| Database | PostgreSQL | 14+ | Data persistence |**Points vs Quota Points:**

| Language | TypeScript | 5.6.3 | Type-safe development |

| Runtime | Node.js | 18+ | Execution environment |- **quota_points**: For organizers (organizing runs) and verifiers (verifying members) - currently active

| Validation | Zod | 3.23.8 | Schema validation |- **points**: For raiders (completing runs, popping keys) - fully implemented with raider points config and key pop tracking

| Logging | Pino | Latest | Structured logging |

| Deployment | Docker Compose | 3.9 | Container orchestration |**Automatic Tracking:**



---- When a run is ended (via "End" button or auto-end), a quota event is automatically logged

- When a member is verified (manual `/verify` or automated RealmEye verification), a quota event is automatically logged

## Maintenance- When keys are logged via `/logkey`, key pop points are tracked and awarded based on configuration

- Points are awarded based on dungeon type and role-specific overrides

### Database Backups

**Configurable Point Values:**

Regular backups are essential. Use `pg_dump` for PostgreSQL backups:

- Default: 1 point per run completed, 1 point per verification

```bash- Per-dungeon overrides: Set custom point values (e.g., Shatters = 3 points, Fungal = 2 points)

docker-compose exec db pg_dump -U postgres rotmg_raids > backup_$(date +%Y%m%d).sql- Per-role configuration: Different roles can have different point values for the same dungeon

```

**Quota Periods:**

### Log Management

- Configured with absolute datetime resets (e.g., "Resets on December 1, 2025 at 00:00 UTC")

Logs are written to stdout/stderr. Configure log rotation in production:- `created_at` tracks when the current quota period started

- `reset_at` defines when the next reset occurs

```bash- After reset, manually update `reset_at` to the next period and `created_at` to NOW

docker-compose logs --tail=1000 bot > bot_logs.txt

docker-compose logs --tail=1000 backend > backend_logs.txt**Leaderboard Panels:**

```

- Auto-updating embeds posted in the quota channel

### Monitoring- Show top 25 members with quota points

- Display who has met quota (✅) and who hasn't

Monitor these key metrics:- Include rank indicators (🥇🥈🥉)

- Update in real-time when runs end or verifications occur

- Database connection pool usage

- API response times### Configuration Workflow

- Command execution success rate

- Scheduled task completion1. **Set up role**: `/configquota role:@Raid Leader`

- Error rates by type2. **Configure basics**: Click "Set Basic Config" button

   - Set required points (e.g., 10 points to meet quota)

### Updates   - Set reset datetime (e.g., 2025-12-01T00:00:00Z)

3. **Set dungeon overrides**: Click "Configure Dungeons" button

To update the bot:   - Select dungeon from dropdown

   - Enter point value (e.g., 3 for Shatters)

1. Pull latest changes: `git pull origin main`4. **Create panel**: Click "Update Panel" button

2. Rebuild containers: `docker-compose build`   - Bot posts leaderboard in quota channel

3. Restart services: `docker-compose up -d`   - Panel auto-updates when quota events occur

4. Check logs: `docker-compose logs -f bot backend`5. **Reset quota**: Click "Reset Panel" button when period ends

   - Updates `created_at` to NOW (start new period)

---   - Keeps same `reset_at` until you update it



## Support & Documentation### Manual Quota Management



- **Internal Docs**: See `bot/src/services/realmeye/README.md` and `backend/test/README.md`**Manually log runs** (for retroactive tracking or corrections):

- **Issue Reporting**: Include error messages, setup details, and steps to reproduce

- **Version**: Check version with `/ping` command or in this README```text

/logrun dungeon:Shatters amount:1

**Last Updated:** November 17, 2025  /logrun dungeon:Fungal amount:-1  # Remove 1 point

**Status:** Production Ready```


**Manually log key pops** (track raider key contributions):

```text
/logkey member:@Raider dungeon:Shatters amount:1
/logkey member:@Raider dungeon:Fungal amount:-1  # Remove 1 key
```

**Manually adjust points** (for corrections or special awards):

```text
/addpoints member:@Raider amount:5       # Add raider points
/addquotapoints member:@Officer amount:3  # Add quota points
```

**View statistics**:

```text
/stats                    # Your own stats
/stats member:@OtherUser  # Someone else's stats
```

**Sync team role** (after adding new staff):

```text
/syncteam  # Auto-assigns Team role to all members with staff roles
```

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you dive in, make sure you have:

- **Node.js 18+** (the bot uses modern JS features)
- **Docker & Docker Compose** (easiest way to run everything)
- **PostgreSQL 14+** (if you're not using Docker)
- **A Discord Bot Token** (create one at [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications))

### Installation

**Option 1: Docker Compose (Recommended)**

This is the easiest way. Everything runs in containers, no need to install Postgres or worry about dependencies.

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd rotmg-raid-bot
```

Create `backend/.env`:

```env
PORT=4000
BACKEND_API_KEY=your_secret_key_here_make_it_long
DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres:postgres@db:5432/rotmg_raids
```

Create `bot/.env`:

```env
APPLICATION_ID=your_discord_app_id
SECRET_KEY=your_discord_bot_token
DISCORD_DEV_GUILD_ID=your_test_server_id
BACKEND_URL=http://backend:4000/v1
BACKEND_API_KEY=your_secret_key_here_make_it_long
```

**Important**: The `BACKEND_API_KEY` must match in both files. This is how the bot authenticates with the API.

Start everything:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

The first startup takes a minute—it installs dependencies, runs migrations, and registers commands. Check the logs:

```bash
docker-compose logs -f bot
```

**Option 2: Manual Setup**

If you prefer running things locally (useful for development):

**Backend:**

```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm run migrate  # Sets up database tables
npm run dev      # Starts with hot reload
```

**Bot:**

```bash
cd bot
npm install
npm run register # Registers slash commands with Discord
npm run dev      # Starts with hot reload
```

Make sure your PostgreSQL is running and the `DATABASE_URL` in `backend/.env` points to it.

### Initial Setup

Once the bot's online, you need to configure it in your Discord server:

**1. Configure Roles** (Required)

Run `/setroles` to map your Discord roles to bot permissions:

```
/setroles
  administrator: @Admin
  moderator: @Moderator  
  security: @Security
  organizer: @Raid Leader
  officer: @Officer
  verified_raider: @Verified
  suspended: @Suspended
  team: @Team
```

At minimum, set up `organizer`, `security`, and `verified_raider`. The bot won't work properly without these.

**2. Configure Channels** (Recommended)

Run `/setchannels` to tell the bot where to log stuff:

```
/setchannels
  raid: #raids
  veri_log: #verification-log
  punishment_log: #moderation-log
  raid_log: #raid-threads
  quota: #quota-leaderboards
  getverified: #get-verified
  manual_verification: #manual-verifications
  bot_log: #bot-activity
```

**3. Test It**

Try creating a run:

```
/run dungeon:Shatters
```

If everything's set up correctly, you'll see an embed with buttons. Click "Join" to make sure interactions work.

---

## How to Use

### Creating Runs

The `/run` command is your main tool. It includes autocomplete that remembers what your server runs most often:

```
/run dungeon:Shatters party:Nexus2 location:USEast description:Bring priest pls
```

What happens next:

1. Bot creates a database record
2. Posts an embed in your raid channel with buttons
3. Players click "Join" and select their class
4. You (or someone with Organizer role) click "Organizer Panel" to Start/End the run
5. If you forget to end it, the bot does it automatically after 2 hours

**Headcounts** are lighter-weight—use them to check interest before starting a full run:

```
/headcount
```

Pick up to 10 dungeons from the dropdown. Players can join and indicate which dungeons they have keys for. When you're ready, convert it to a full run or just end it.

### Verification System

There are two ways to verify players:

**RealmEye (Automated):**

1. Set up the verification panel: `/configverification send-panel channel:#get-verified`
2. Players click "Get Verified" → bot DMs them
3. They provide their IGN → bot gives them a code
4. They add the code to their RealmEye profile
5. Bot verifies and assigns the Verified Raider role automatically

**Manual (Screenshot):**

1. Same panel, but players choose "Manual Verification"
2. They upload a screenshot of their vault with their Discord tag visible
3. Creates a ticket in your manual_verification channel
4. Security+ staff review and approve/deny
5. Bot handles role assignment

**Manual Override:**

Security staff can always use `/verify` to manually verify someone:

```
/verify member:@Player ign:TheirRotmgName
```

### Moderation Tools

**Warnings:**

```
/warn member:@Player reason:Rushing ahead and dying
```

**Suspensions:**

```
/suspend member:@Player duration_days:3 reason:Repeated rule violations
```

The bot assigns the Suspended role immediately and removes it automatically when time's up.

**Checking History:**

```
/checkpunishments member:@Player
```

Shows all warnings, suspensions, and staff notes. Pagination works if there's a lot.

**Staff Notes:**

```
/addnote member:@Player note:Keep an eye on this one, been acting sus
```

Notes are private—only Security+ staff can see them.

### Quota System Explained

Quota tracks how active your organizers and verifiers are. It's optional but useful for promoting people or just recognizing top contributors.

**Setup:**

```
/configquota role:@Raid Leader
```

This opens an interactive panel where you:

- Set required points (e.g., "Must complete 10 runs per month")
- Configure reset datetime (absolute time like "2025-12-01T00:00:00Z")
- Override point values per dungeon (Shatters = 3 points, Pirate Cave = 1 point)
- Create a leaderboard panel that updates automatically

**How Points Work:**

- Every time a run ends (via "End" button or auto-end), the organizer gets points
- Every verification adds points to the verifier
- Every key pop can award points (configurable via `/configpoints`)
- Points are calculated based on dungeon type and role-specific overrides

**Manual Adjustments:**

```
/logrun dungeon:Shatters amount:1  # Add quota points
/logkey member:@Raider dungeon:Shatters amount:1  # Log keys popped
/addquotapoints member:@Officer amount:5  # Direct point adjustment
```

**View Stats:**

```
/stats  # Your own stats
/stats member:@OtherPerson  # Someone else's stats
```

## File Structure

### Current Limitations

1. **No Bench/Leave Buttons**: UI only shows "Join" button. Backend supports bench/leave states, but not exposed in UI for runs.

2. **No Reaction List Command**: Can't view who joined a run except by counting in the embed.

3. **No Run History**: Past runs aren't queryable via commands (data exists in database).

4. **Single-Guild Testing**: Primarily tested in one server; multi-guild scenarios may have edge cases.

5. **No Voice Integration**: No automated voice channel creation or management.

6. **Fixed Auto-End Duration**: 2-hour auto-end is hardcoded in `/run` command, not configurable per-guild.

7. **No Analytics Dashboard**: Command logs are stored but not visualized anywhere.

### Known Bugs

1. **Class Button Label**: Button says "Class" but opens dropdown - could be clearer.

2. **No Validation on Startup**: Missing environment variables cause runtime errors instead of failing fast.

## Known Issues & Limitations

Let's be honest about what doesn't work perfectly or what's missing:

### What's Missing

**No Bench/Leave Buttons Yet**  
The UI only shows a "Join" button. The backend fully supports bench and leave states, but I haven't exposed them in the UI. You can join, but you can't mark yourself as benched or leave without the organizer ending the run.

**Can't View Who Joined**  
There's no `/viewrun` command to see the full list of participants. You have to rely on the counter in the embed. If you need details, you'd have to query the database directly.

**No Run History Command**  
All past runs are stored in the database, but there's no command to browse them. Want to see how many Shatters you organized last month? You can't... yet.

**Auto-End Duration is Fixed**  
Every run auto-ends after 2 hours. This is hardcoded in the `/run` command. If you want to change it, you need to modify the code.

**No Voice Channel Integration**  
The bot doesn't create or manage voice channels. You're on your own for that.

**Single-Server Focus**  
This bot has been primarily tested in one server. Multi-guild edge cases probably exist, especially around permission checking and role management.

### Known Bugs

**Missing Env Var Validation**  
If you forget to set environment variables, the bot crashes at runtime with cryptic errors instead of telling you upfront what's missing. Not ideal for first-time setup.

**Race Conditions on Run Status**  
If two organizers click "Start" or "End" at the exact same time, weird things can happen. The backend doesn't use optimistic locking, so both requests might go through.

**Bot Role Position Issues**  
If the bot's role is lower than a user's role, it can't manage them. Commands like `/suspend` will fail with a 403 error. The bot checks this for most operations, but not all.

**Quota Reset is Manual**  
The quota system has a reset datetime, but it doesn't automatically reset points. You have to manually update the `reset_at` field when a period ends.

### Performance Concerns

**No Caching Layer**  
Every permission check hits the database. For small servers this is fine, but if you have thousands of members, it might get slow. A Redis cache would help.

**No Rate Limiting**  
The backend has no rate limit protection. Someone could spam the API if they wanted to. This is mostly safe because the API key is private, but still.

**Leaderboard Fetching**  
Quota leaderboards fetch all members with a role, then query stats for each one. This works fine for <100 people but could be optimized with better SQL queries.

### Things That Could Go Wrong

**Orphaned Runs**  
If a channel or guild gets deleted while a run is active, the run stays in the database forever. There's no cleanup task for this.

**Discord Outages**  
If Discord goes down mid-operation, the bot's scheduled tasks (auto-end, suspension cleanup) will fail. They retry on the next run, but there could be delays.

**Database Migrations**  
There are 32 migration files. If you're setting up from scratch, they all run sequentially. If one fails halfway through, you need to manually fix it—there are no rollback scripts.

**Multi-Guild Quota**  
If you run this bot in multiple servers, quota is tracked per-guild but shares the same database. This is fine, but be aware that quota role configs are guild-specific.

---

## Troubleshooting

**Bot doesn't respond to commands**

- Check that slash commands are registered: `docker-compose logs bot | grep "Successfully registered"`
- Verify the bot has the correct permissions in your server (at minimum: Send Messages, Embed Links, Manage Roles)
- Make sure you've run `/setroles` to configure at least the organizer and verified_raider roles

**"NOT_ORGANIZER" error when creating runs**

- You need the Organizer role configured in `/setroles`
- Check that you actually have that Discord role assigned
- Verify the bot can see your roles (permission issue if you can't)

**Backend connection errors**

- Check `BACKEND_URL` in `bot/.env` matches where the backend is running
- Verify `BACKEND_API_KEY` matches in both `bot/.env` and `backend/.env`
- If using Docker: make sure services can communicate (check `docker-compose logs`)

**Database migration failures**

- Check PostgreSQL is running and accessible
- Verify `DATABASE_URL` format: `postgres://user:pass@host:port/database`
- Look at migration files in `backend/src/db/migrations/` to see which one failed
- You might need to manually fix the schema and re-run

**Verification not working**

- Make sure you've set up channels: `/setchannels getverified:#your-channel`
- For RealmEye verification, check that the service is accessible (sometimes it's down)
- For manual verification, ensure the manual_verification channel is configured
- Check that the bot has permission to send DMs (users must allow DMs from server members)

**Quota panels not updating**

- Verify the quota channel is set: `/setchannels quota:#your-channel`
- Make sure the bot has permission to send/edit messages in that channel
- Check that the role in `/configquota` actually exists and has members
- Try manually triggering an update by completing a run or logging quota

**Role management fails with 403 errors**

- The bot's role must be higher than the roles it's trying to manage
- Check role hierarchy in Server Settings > Roles
- The bot needs "Manage Roles" permission
- You can't manage Discord owners or administrators (this is a Discord limitation)

## � Suggestions for Future Improvements

### Code Organization & Architecture

1. **Modularize Backend Routes**
   - **Current**: All logic in route files (runs.ts, quota.ts, etc.)
   - **Improvement**: Extract business logic into service layer (`services/run-service.ts`, `services/quota-service.ts`)
   - **Benefit**: Easier testing, better separation of concerns, reusable business logic
   - **Priority**: Medium (code works but could be cleaner)

2. **Implement Repository Pattern for Database**
   - **Current**: Raw SQL queries scattered across lib files
   - **Improvement**: Create repository classes (`repositories/RunRepository.ts`, `repositories/QuotaRepository.ts`)
   - **Benefit**: Centralize database logic, easier to mock for testing, consistent query patterns
   - **Priority**: Medium

3. **Add Request/Response DTOs**
   - **Current**: Type definitions inline or implicit
   - **Improvement**: Create explicit DTO (Data Transfer Object) classes with validation
   - **Benefit**: Better type safety, self-documenting API, easier to maintain
   - **Priority**: Low

4. **Consolidate Error Handling**
   - **Current**: Mix of try-catch blocks and BackendError class
   - **Improvement**: Unified error middleware, custom error hierarchy
   - **Benefit**: Consistent error responses, better error tracking
   - **Priority**: High

### Performance & Scalability

5. **Add Caching Layer (Redis)**
   - **Current**: Every permission check queries database
   - **Target**: Cache guild role/channel mappings, quota configs
   - **Benefit**: Reduce database load, faster permission checks
   - **Priority**: Medium (only needed for larger servers)

6. **Optimize Quota Leaderboard Queries**
   - **Current**: Fetches all members, then filters
   - **Improvement**: Use database aggregation, pagination
   - **Benefit**: Faster leaderboard updates, less memory usage
   - **Priority**: Low (works fine for <1000 members per role)

7. **Batch Database Operations**
   - **Current**: Auto-end processes runs one-by-one
   - **Improvement**: Batch update multiple runs in single transaction
   - **Benefit**: Faster cleanup tasks, reduced database connections
   - **Priority**: Low

8. **Add Rate Limiting**
   - **Current**: No protection against API abuse
   - **Improvement**: Implement Fastify rate limit plugin
   - **Benefit**: Prevent spam, protect backend from DOS
   - **Priority**: Medium

### Testing & Quality

9. **Implement Unit Tests**
   - **Coverage**: Authorization logic, quota calculations, dungeon search
   - **Tools**: Vitest or Jest
   - **Priority**: High (critical for maintaining code quality as features grow)

10. **Add Integration Tests**
    - **Coverage**: API endpoints, database migrations, permission flows
    - **Tools**: Supertest + test database
    - **Priority**: High

11. **Add End-to-End Tests**
    - **Coverage**: Discord command flows, button interactions
    - **Tools**: Discord.js testing utilities
    - **Priority**: Medium

12. **Set Up CI/CD Pipeline**
    - **Current**: Manual deployment
    - **Improvement**: GitHub Actions for tests, lint, build, deploy
    - **Benefit**: Catch bugs before production, automated deployments
    - **Priority**: Medium

### Features & User Experience

13. **Add Bench/Leave Buttons**
    - **Current**: Only "Join" button visible (backend supports bench/leave)
    - **Improvement**: Add buttons to run embeds, update handlers
    - **Benefit**: Complete reaction state management
    - **Priority**: High (partially implemented in backend)

14. **Raider Participation Tracking**
    - **Current**: Only organizers and verifiers earn quota points
    - **Improvement**: Track raider participation (joins, completes), use `points` field
    - **Benefit**: Reward active raiders, not just organizers
    - **Priority**: Medium (requires design decisions on how to track "completion")

15. **Automated Quota Reset**
    - **Current**: Manual reset via "Reset Panel" button
    - **Improvement**: Scheduled task to auto-reset at configured datetime
    - **Benefit**: Hands-off quota management
    - **Priority**: Medium

16. **Run History & Analytics**
    - **Command**: `/runhistory [member] [dungeon] [days]`
    - **Show**: Past runs, completion rates, most organized dungeons
    - **Priority**: Low (data exists, just needs query + command)

17. **Enhanced Leaderboards**
    - **Command**: `/leaderboard type:[organizers|raiders|dungeons]`
    - **Show**: Server-wide stats, not just per-role
    - **Priority**: Low

18. **Voice Channel Integration**
    - **Feature**: Auto-create voice channel on run start, delete on end
    - **Benefit**: Streamlined raid experience
    - **Priority**: Low (nice-to-have)

19. **Afk Check System**
    - **Feature**: React-to-join window before run starts
    - **Benefit**: Ensure participants are active
    - **Priority**: Low

20. **Custom Dungeon Management**
    - **Commands**: `/adddungeon`, `/editdungeon`
    - **Benefit**: Support guild-specific custom dungeons
    - **Priority**: Low

### DevOps & Monitoring

21. **Structured Logging**
    - **Current**: `console.log` and basic Fastify logger
    - **Improvement**: Pino or Winston with log levels, structured format
    - **Benefit**: Better debugging, log aggregation (e.g., ELK stack)
    - **Priority**: Medium

22. **Health Checks & Monitoring**
    - **Current**: Basic `/health` endpoint
    - **Improvement**: Liveness/readiness probes, metrics (Prometheus)
    - **Benefit**: Better uptime monitoring, easier Kubernetes deployment
    - **Priority**: Low (unless deploying to production cluster)

23. **Environment Variable Validation**
    - **Current**: Runtime crashes if env vars missing
    - **Improvement**: Zod schema validation on startup
    - **Benefit**: Fail fast with clear error messages
    - **Priority**: High

24. **Database Migration Rollback**
    - **Current**: Migrations only go forward
    - **Improvement**: Add down migrations for rollback
    - **Benefit**: Safer deployments, easier to revert
    - **Priority**: Medium

### Documentation & Onboarding

25. **API Documentation**
    - **Tool**: Swagger/OpenAPI for backend routes
    - **Benefit**: Self-documenting API, easier integration
    - **Priority**: Low

26. **Developer Setup Guide**

## Contributing

Want to improve the bot? Here's how:

### Getting Started

1. Fork the repo and clone it locally
2. Set up the development environment (see [Installation](#installation))
3. Pick something to work on—check the [Known Issues](#known-issues--limitations) section for ideas
4. Make your changes and test them thoroughly

### Code Style

- Use TypeScript for everything
- Run the existing code through your formatter before committing
- Add JSDoc comments for complex functions
- Use Zod for input validation
- Keep functions focused—if it's doing too much, split it up

### Testing Your Changes

Right now there are no automated tests (yeah, I know). Test manually by:

- Creating runs and interacting with buttons
- Testing permission checks with different roles
- Verifying edge cases (missing config, invalid input, etc.)
- Checking database state after operations

If you want to add tests, that would be amazing. Look at the file structure and create tests in a `__tests__` directory.

### Pull Request Guidelines

- Write a clear description of what your PR does
- Reference any related issues
- Make sure the bot still starts up and basic commands work
- If you're adding a new feature, update this README

### Areas That Need Help

- **Tests**: We need unit tests, integration tests, any tests really
- **Environment validation**: Add startup checks for required env vars
- **Bench/Leave buttons**: Expose the backend functionality in the UI
- **Run history command**: Query and display past runs
- **Voice integration**: Auto-create voice channels for runs
- **Performance**: Add Redis caching, optimize queries, add rate limiting
- **Documentation**: More examples, better error messages, video tutorials
